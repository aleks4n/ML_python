#you have labes in supervised learning
#you dont have labels in unsupervised learning just pure data 

##Computing merhods
#1. K-means clustering
#2. Dimonsonality reduction

# there are man distrubution in the data

#high inner cluster similarity
#low outer cluster similarity

#Cluster quality measures 

#Flat clustering


#compute the means in the cluster according to the new elements that you are adding
