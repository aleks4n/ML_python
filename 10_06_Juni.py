#Exervise 5 Neuroal Network
# Neural network is a function approximator, which approximates the function f(x) = y
# There are two types of neural networks: feedforward and convolutional
# Feedforward neural networks are the most common type of neural networks
# At feedforward all the neurons are connected
# each neuron has a bias and a weight
# Backpropagation is the most common algorithm to train a neural network
# We need activation functions to introduce non-linearity in the neural network
# update the parameters of the neural network using the gradient descent algorithm
